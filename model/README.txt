This folder contains trained Random Forest Regression models that predict sea ice thickness from CIS ice charts and scatterometer data. There are seperate models for two types of scatterometer (C-band and Ku-band) and each of the winter months (November-April). The models are trained on, and can be used on, a dataset with 24 features:
- Partial concentration New Ice (between 0 and 1)
- Partial concentration Nilas
- Partial concentration Young Ice 
- Partial concentration Grey Ice
- Partial concentration Grey White Ice
- Partial concentration FYI
- Partial concentration thin FYI 
- Partial concentration first stage thin FYI
- Partial concentration second stage thin FYI
- Partial concentration medium FYI
- Partial concentration thick FYI
- Partial concentration Old Ice
- Partial concentration second-year ice
- Partial concentration MYI
- Partial concentration pancake ice
- Partial concentration small ice cake
- Partial concentration ice cake
- Partial concentration small floe
- Partial concentration medium floe
- Partial concentration big floe
- Partial concentration vast floe
- Partial concentration giant floe
- Partial concentration fast ice
- Scatterometer backscatter (between -30 and 0)
