Code creates a Random Forest Regression model that creates a proxy product for Canadian Arctic sea ice thickness. The dataset that is used contains parameters (stage of development and floe size) from the Canadian Ice Service charts and scatterometer backscatter. The Random Forest Regression is trained on observed CryoSat-2 sea ice thickness.
